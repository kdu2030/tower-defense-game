This is a 2D Game that I worked on using Unity and C#. The sprites are by Craftpix and artists on Open Game Art.

# Features
* Enemies will follow a path across the game's map
* Turrents will detect an enemy's presence and shoot at them
* Bullets will follow the enemy
* When an enemy is hit, they will have a health bar
* Players can place turrents on the map
* The game will prevent the user from placing a turrent on a terrain object (e.g. a tree, a tent, etc.), the pathway, or on another turrent
